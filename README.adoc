=== Hard mode

If you want to experience the latest midis2jam2 updates in between releases, you can download a CI build.
Note: these builds are unstable, so I won't provide any support for them (although, you should submit issues for pertinent bugs).

==== Getting the binary

You can either use a prebuilt binary or build from source.

===== Using a prebuilt binary

To begin, download a build from the https://www.midis2jam2.xyz/builds/[builds page].
Move `midis2jam2-xxxxxxxx.jar` to a new folder (the Xs are a placeholder here; when you download the jar, this is the beginning of the commit hash).

===== Building from source

To build midis2jam2, run

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/wyskoj/midis2jam2
$ cd midis2jam2
$ ./gradlew shadowjar
----

The jar file appears in `build/libs`.
Copy it to a new folder.

You will need at least _Java 15_ in order for a successful build.

==== Running

To run midis2jam2, simply execute the jar file:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar midis2jam2.jar

You can optionally specify the relative or absolute path to a MIDI file. midis2jam2 will load and play the file using the default synthesizer Gervill:

== FAQ & Troubleshooting

=== The program closed, but all the notes are sustaining.

Press the MIDI panic button on your synthesizer to stop the sound.

=== I think something is broken.

Check the issues page and make sure there isn't already a relevant issue open.
If there isn't, create an issue and use the bug report template.

=== Why doesn't instrument _X_ appear?

It's likely I haven't implemented it yet.
Check link:implementation.adoc[this page] for more information.

=== MidiUnavailableException: There is not enough memory available for this task...

This can happen if you attempt to use ghost/phantom MIDI ports that appear visible on your machine.
Try restarting your computer or reconnecting your MIDI devices.
