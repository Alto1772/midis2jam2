    midis2jam2

SYNOPSIS
    midis2jam2 [options] [<input-file>]

DESCRIPTION
    midis2jam2 is a 3D MIDI file visualizer. It is a re-implementation of MIDIJam. It is written in Kotlin/JVM and uses
    JMonkeyEngine3 for graphics. By default, it will open a GUI launcher that allows the user to select a MIDI file to
    play, among other settings.

    If no input file is specified, the program will open a GUI launcher. If an input file is specified, the program will
    start playing the MIDI file immediately with the specified settings.

OPTIONS
    -a, --autocam
        Starts the application with the autocam feature enabled.

    -d, --device <device_name>
        The device to use for MIDI playback. If this value is not specified, the default device will be used. To see the
         available devices, use the --list-devices option.

    -e, --legacy-engine
        On some systems, the new display window does not work. Use this option to use the legacy window engine.

    -f, --fullscreen
        Starts the application in fullscreen mode.

    -h, --help
        Prints this help message and exits.

    -l, --list-devices
        Lists the available MIDI devices and exits.

    -s, --soundfont <soundfont_file>
        This option only has an effect if the --device option is either not specified or is the default device. It
        specifies the SoundFont to use for MIDI playback by a path to a SoundFont file. If this option is not specified,
        the default internal SoundFont will be used.

    -v, --version
        Prints the version of this program and exits.

    -y, --latency <milliseconds>
        If this option is specified, the MIDI playback will be delayed by the specified number of milliseconds. This
        option is useful to align the video with the audio.
